# Project Euler
### *Selection of Project Euler Problems*

Each folder contains my submitted solutions in Java to the various [Project Euler Problems](https://projecteuler.net). 

The aim of this repository is to help other aspiring Eulers who struggles with a certain problem and need some hints. 
It is recommended to **try your own solutions first**, and, if nothing works, take a look at my attempts!
